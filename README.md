# CS-2110
All of my coding work for CS 2110: Software Development Methods

This course was taught at UVA as a part of the old computer science curriculum, introducing students to concepts such as object-oriented programming, inheritance and polymorphism, multithreading, and more.
This particular version of the course was co-taught by Professors Basit, Stone, and Graham in the fall semester of 2020.

I have made this repository public in January of 2023 because the UVA CS department has changed its curriculum such that CS 2110 is no longer offered to CS students, so my releasing of this code is not considered an honor violation. I'm not aware how similar the assignments are in the new CS 2100, so if you are a professor and would like me to make this repository private again, please email me at wyz5rge@virginia.edu and I will do so immediately.
