Page 358 Figure 7.5 change private Object data; -> private T data; and thhe class definition to public class GTreeNode<T> {

Page 373 Figure 7.10 consider changeing pre, in, and post order methods to accepts type java.lang.reflect.Method cb instead of type Callback 
otherwise import javax.security.auth.callback.Callback; where needed since it gives errors w/o it.

Page 375 Figure 7.12 change class description to public class BinaryTreeNde<T>{ and change private Object data; -> private T data

Page 383 Figure 7.13 The code for BinaryTreeNode and LinkedBinaryTree are in two separate files (that i sent you), in the book they apprear in the same 
blue box. If there is a way to show more separation between these two classes that would be good.

<IMPORTANT>
Page 389 Figure 7.13 - in my code I wans't sure how to make the equals method generic since it needs to override the equals method, making it anything 
other than object causes an error. This seems tricky since I am keeping things as just BinaryTree in equals but equalsHelper needs a BinaryTree<T> type. 
Let me know what you think about this one.
This also goes for the BinaryTree, LinkedBinaryTree, ArrayBasedBinaryTree
</IMPORTANT>

Page 415 Figure 7.17 - since the BinarySearchTree interface doesn't reference Object, does the class need to be declared as public interace 
BinarySearchTree<T> ? I think so, and the Comparable object will be generic. Along these same lines, check the compareTo method of 
BinarySearchTreeNode and LinkedBinarySearchTree to see if the casting is how you would do it.

Page 441 Figure 7.34 - I can't find the code for this, the insertHeapNode. I don't have the code for the getSmallest method either on the next page. 
Let me know if you have it, if you need me to I will type it up again if it is lost.
